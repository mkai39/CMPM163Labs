From left to right:

The first cube is the phong material shader with a green tint as guided from the lab.

The second cube is a red cube that I made using Three.js library Lambert shader and is partially transparent. I put a smaller cube inside it to show the transparency.

The third cube is a purple cube I made using Phong shader again, but as a wireframe with a light blue specular reflection.

The fourth cube is one I made with my own shader by mixing red, green, and blue to try and remake the cube in the lab header.

The fifth cube is one that uses the interpolation as guided from the lab. I chose my own colors as directed.
