From left to right:

- The first cube is the Phong material shader with a green tint as guided from the lab.

- The second cube is a purple cube I made using Phong shader again, but as a wireframe with a light blue specular reflection. (The blue looks white in the video).

- The third cube is a red cube that I made using Three.js library Lambert shader and is partially transparent. I put a smaller cube inside it to show the transparency.

- The fourth cube is one that uses the interpolation as guided from the lab. I chose my own colors as directed.

- The fifth cube is one I made with my own shader by setting the RGB values of gl_FragColor to equal the respective XYZ position, my attempt to create the shader for the rainbow cube in the lab3 header.

- The sixth cube is one I also made with my own shader, by setting the RGB values of gl_FragColor to the positions of the same axis (X, in this case) at different offset intervals. It made a cool blue gradient that reminds me of the sky.
